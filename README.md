manual hacking about with github

this is the first new branch off master. I'll add some exciting new features here!
New features (planned):
turbo boost
rocket option
time displacement drive

turbo boost looks easy, a 5 minute job
rocket option is do-able too, found a nearby firework factory. we can tie loads together to get as much thrust as required.
TDD proving harder!
